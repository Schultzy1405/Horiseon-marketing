# Horiseon-marketing

## Project Description 

 ### Goal was to cut down on the amount of CSS code and change html elements for better accessibility. This project has helped me understand more about HTML and how CSS works together to make a unique webpage. ![image](https://github.com/Schultzy1405/Horiseon-marketing/assets/156715689/1aa7930c-4d22-4f0b-a38d-4277c6953611) 

 ### To do this project, I used starter code that had a bunch of CSS code that could have been grouped in quite a few ways. One of the challenges I faced was trying to figure out where in the style.css I had to fix due to an edit on the index.html side. In the future I hope to be able to spot these fixes faster and more efficient.
